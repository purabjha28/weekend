  <h2 style="color: red;"><i>His top 10 songs are:</i></h2>
  <h3 style="color: ghostwhite;">1.Blinding Lights
    <br>“Blinding Lights” is synonymous with The Weeknd’s name, and for good reason. The dance-friendly beat begs the
    listener to move and groove with its electric energy. The song has an anthemic feel that one can’t help but sing
    along to. It’s the kind of song that reaches through the speakers to grab you, not letting go until the song’s end.
    “Blinding Lights” has set all kinds of records, including being the most streamed song of all time on Spotify. It’s
    safe to say that “Blinding Lights” has helped further The Weeknd’s lasting legacy.</br>

      lights</a></strong>
  <h3 style="color: ghostwhite;"> 2.“Starboy”
    <br>Between its enticing melody and the instantly recognizable chorus, this collaboration with Daft Punk is
    certainly a stand-out. The singer tackles the outlandish lifestyle that comes with being a public figure, often
    trading human connection for material possessions, as reflected in such lyrics as a hundred on the dash / Get me
    close to God / We don’t pray for love / We just pray for cars. “Starboy” is one of The Weeknd’s defining songs and
    is likely to remain that way for the remainder of his career
  </h3>
  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=34Na4j8AVgA&t=2s" style="color: red;"
      target="_blank">Starboy</strong></a>
  <h3 style="color: ghostwhite;">3. “Save Your Tears”
    <br>The Weeknd will gently pull you in with his mystifying voice on “Save Your Tears.” With an expertly crafted pop
    melody that doesn’t let your ear off the hook, the song’s image-heavy lyrics will also peak one’s interest. With
    images of a single tear falling down one’s cheek and dancing crowds, “Save Your Tears” will win you over in spite of
    its somber nature.
  </h3>
  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXYlFuWEuKI" style="color: red;" target="_blank"> Save your tears
  </strong></a>
  <h3 style="color:ghostwhite;"> 4.“Creepin'”
    <br>The Weeknd demonstrates the convincing power of his vocals on this collaboration with 21 Savage and Metro
    Boomin. Here, he pulls you into his sorrow as he hears that the woman he loves has been caught cheating. But instead
    of facing the issue directly, he’d rather suffer in silence than be without her. The Weeknd makes you believe him
    when he plaintively sings, I don’t wanna know / If you’re playing me / Keep it on the low / ‘Cause my heart can’t
    take it anymore.
  </h3>
  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UcFeTfm1oM" style="color: red;" target="_blank">creepin</strong></a>
  <h3 style="color: ghostwhite;">5.“Can’t Feel My Face”
    <br>“Can’t Feel My Face” is likely one of the songs that come to mind when one thinks of The Weeknd. The strength
    and variety in his voice shine through on lyrics that find him confessing that even though he knows a relationship
    is toxic, he can’t help but love it. Between the earworm groove and The Weeknd’s impressive vocals, “Can’t Feel My
    Face” is a classic in his catalog.
  </h3>
  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEI4qSrkPAs" style="color:red;" target="_blank"> cant feel my
      face</strong></a>
  <h3 style="color:ghostwhite;">6.“I Feel it Coming”
    <br>The Weeknd defines smooth with “I Feel it Coming.” This romantic bop captures the spirit of someone being a
    sanctuary for their partner who has been burned by love in the past. The Weeknd vows to be that safe space for her
    as he croons, you’ve been scared of love and what it did to you/You don’t have to run/I know what you’ve been
    through/Just a simple touch and it can set you free/We don’t have to rush when you’re alone with me. With its catchy
    melody and thoughtful lyrics, “I Feel it Coming” is a must-listen in The Weeknd’s catalog.
  </h3>
  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qFLhGq0060w" style="color: red;" target="_blank"> I feel it
      coming</strong></a>
  <h3 style="color:ghostwhite;">7.“Die For You”
    <br>“Die For You” is easily one of The Weeknd’s best. Like “Creepin,'” he explores the depths of pain when it comes
    to love that he can’t escape, pleading through the lyrics, I try to find a reason to pull us apart/It ain’t
    workin’/’Cause you’re perfect, and I know that you’re worth it/I can’t walk away. In 2023, The Weeknd released a
    remix featuring Ariana Grande, whose soft voice is a nice addition that elevates the song’s pain. Their combined
    efforts help bring the song to new heights on the Billboard Hot 100, reaching a peak of No. 6.

  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPD0QOGTmMI" style="color: red;" target="_blank"> Die For
      you</strong></a>
  <h3 style="color:ghostwhite;">8.“Earned It”
    <br>“Earned It” rose to fame as part of the soundtrack of the film Fifty Shades of Grey. With its smoldering chamber
    pop melody complete with booming drums accented by ominous violins, “Earned It” is one of The Weeknd’s signature
    songs. The song earned critical and commercial acclaim, winning Best R&B Performance at the 2016 Grammy Awards and
    was nominated for Best Original Song at the 2016 Academy Awards, in addition to charting around the world.

  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waU75jdUnYw" style="color: red;" target="_blank">Earned
      it</strong></a>
  <h3 style="color:ghostwhite;">9. “The Hills”
    <br>From the eerie, electronic opening notes, “The Hills” is a song that quickly grabs one’s attention. The
    throbbing bass is layered over lyrics wherein the singer is engaging in NSFW behavior with a woman who’s already
    taken. The Weeknd leans into darkness as he raps I only love it when you touch me/Not feel me/When I’m fucked up,
    that’s the real me. The song shows off the various tones in his voice and became his first No. 1 hit in the U.S.
    when it topped the Billboard Hot 100.
  </h3>
  <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yzTuBuRdAyA" style="color: red;" target="_blank">The
      Hills</strong></a>
  <h3 style="color: ghostwhite;">10 “Prisoner”
    <br>The Weeknd is no stranger to collaboration and “Prisoner” is no exception, calling on Lana Del Rey to help him
    bring this haunting number to life. The song serves as a lament to the woman he loves, professing that she brings
    good to my lonely life while acknowledging that I’m a prisoner to my addiction/I’m addicted to a life that’s so
    empty and so cold. Del Rey’s intoxicating voice has that exact effect when she comes in on the second verse. Though
    it wasn’t officially released as a single, fans gravitated to it so much that it hit No. 13 on the Billboard Hot
    R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.
